# RV-Accel: A 5-Stage RV32IMF SoC with Custom RTL Math and DSP Accelerators

## Overview
This project implements a fully custom, 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor conforming to the RV32IMF instruction set architecture. It is synthesized and optimized for the Digilent Nexys A7 FPGA platform.

### Key Features
- RV32I Base Integer Set: Full 32-bit integer instruction support.
- RV32M Multiply/Divide Extension: Dedicated hardware multiplier and divider unit that correctly handles signed/unsigned operations and architectural edge cases.
- RV32F Single-Precision Floating-Point: Fully custom FPU supporting hardware addition, subtraction, multiplication, iterative division, sign-injection, and bi-directional float-integer conversions. (Had to lower the effective frequency to avoid setup time violations.)
- Memory-Mapped Accelerators (AXI4-Lite):
  - 4x4 Systolic Array: Computes wavefront matrix multiplications.
  - Iterative CORDIC: Hardware trigonometric solver for Sine/Cosine.
- Custom UART Bootloader: A hardware-level bootloader that intercepts serial payloads and flashes them directly into BRAM, allowing you to iterate on C code in seconds without ever having to re-synthesize the FPGA bitstream!

## Hardware Setup & Programming
1. Locate Bitstream: The final compiled hardware bitstream should be stored in the bitstream directory.
2. Program FPGA: Open Xilinx Vivado, open the Hardware Manager, and program the Nexys A7 FPGA with your bitstream.
3. UART Connection: Connect the FPGA board's USB-UART port to your computer. Identify the COM port assigned to the FPGA in your device manager (e.g., COM4).

## The Reset Switch
The processor uses Switch 0 (J15) on the Nexys A7 to control its execution state. The entire design relies on an active-low reset tree.

- Push DOWN (Logic 0): Holds the processor, bootloader, and all peripherals in a clean, frozen Reset state.
- Push UP (Logic 1): Releases the reset, activating the Bootloader to listen for new firmware over the UART line.

## Test Workloads

### 1. RV32M Integer & Math Testing
This workload thoroughly validates the integer pipeline and the hardware Multiply/Divide extension. It explicitly checks architectural edge cases:
- Integer Overflow: Verifies that adding 1 to the maximum 32-bit signed integer (0x7FFFFFFF) wraps cleanly to the minimum negative integer (0x80000000), and vice versa.
- Division by Zero: Asserts that dividing by zero correctly returns -1 (all 1s) and modulo by zero returns the original dividend, strictly adhering to the RISC-V specification.

Steps to run:
1. Push Switch 0 DOWN to hold the FPGA in reset. After that Program (or reprogram) the FPGA using bitstream(top_fpga.bit) present in bitstream directory.
2. Execute the compilation and run command:
   make FILE=c_toolchain/rv32m_full_testing.c run COM=COM4
   (Remember to replace COM4 with your active UART port)
3. The Python script will pause and prompt you to activate the Bootloader.
4. Push Switch 0 UP to release the reset.
5. Press ENTER on your keyboard to flash the payload and view the results.

### 2. RV32F Floating-Point Testing
This workload stresses the floating-point unit pipeline. It exercises IEEE 754 single-precision additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions. It also leverages the processor's combinatorial hardware logic to test sign negation (fsgnjn.s) and bi-directional integer-float conversions (fcvt.w.s and fcvt.s.w).

Steps to run:
1. Push Switch 0 DOWN to hold the FPGA in reset. After that Program (or reprogram) the FPGA using bitstream(top_fpga.bit) present in bitstream directory.
2. Execute the compilation and run command:
   make FILE=c_toolchain/fpu_main.c run COM=COM4
   (Remember to replace COM4 with your active UART port)
3. The Python script will pause and prompt you to activate the Bootloader.
4. Push Switch 0 UP to release the reset.
5. Press ENTER on your keyboard to flash the payload and view the results.

### 3. AXI Hardware Accelerators (Systolic Array & CORDIC)
This workload tests the custom hardware accelerators mapped onto the processor's AXI4-Lite bus.
- CORDIC: Triggers iterative sine and cosine calculations for specific angles via memory-mapped IO.
- Systolic Array: Performs stepwise matrix multiplications, demonstrating the hardware wavefront execution by shifting activations and accumulating partial sums over multiple clock cycles.

Steps to run:
1. Push Switch 0 DOWN to hold the FPGA in reset. After that Program (or reprogram) the FPGA using bitstream(top_fpga.bit) present in bitstream directory.
2. Execute the compilation and run command:
   make FILE=c_toolchain/main.c run COM=COM4
   (Remember to replace COM4 with your active UART port)
3. The Python script will pause and prompt you to activate the Bootloader.
4. Push Switch 0 UP to release the reset.
5. Press ENTER on your keyboard to flash the payload and view the results.
